## Key Concepts

### 1. **Users**
    - Represents a person or a Service that Interact with AWS
    - Each user has a unique set of Security Credentials 


### 2. **Groups**
    - Collections of IAM users.
    - Groups on;y contains users not another Groups
    - Users in groups inherit the permissions assigned to the group.

### 3. **Roles**
    - A set of permissions defining what actions are allowed and denied by an entity in AWS.
    - Roles can be assumed by users, applications, or services.

### 4. **Policies**
    - Documents defining permissions and are associated with users, groups, or roles.
    - Written in JSON and specify what actions are allowed or denied on which resources.

    -Example:
        ```
            {
                "Version" : "2012-10-17",  #Start with this date  
                "id"       : " ",
                "Statement" :  
                [
                        "Sid"      : " ",
                        "Effect"   : " ",
                        "Principal": " ",
                        "Action"   : " ",
                        "Resources": " ",
                        "Condition": " "

                ]

            }
        ```

### 5. **Permissions**
    - It's Basically a Json Document called policies that can be assigned to Users Or groups
        
    - Define what actions a user or service can perform.
    - Managed via policies.

### 6. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Provides an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of authentication.
   - Use Google Authenticator or TOTP

### 7. **Access Keys**
   - Used for programmatic access (CDK/SDK) to AWS services.
   - Consist of an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

### 8. **IAM Best Practices**
   - Enable MFA for privileged users.
   - Use roles for applications that run on EC2 instances.
   - Rotate credentials regularly.
   - Grant least privilege: only the permissions needed to perform a task.

#### IAM Password Policy

> ⚠️ **CAUTION:** Ensuring a strong password policy is critical for maintaining security.

#### Overview
IAM Password Policies allow you to enforce specific password requirements for your AWS users. This helps ensure that passwords meet your organization's security standards.

#### Key Settings

1. **Minimum Password Length**: Specify the minimum number of characters a password must have.
2. **Require Numbers**: Enforce the inclusion of at least one numeric character.
3. **Require Symbols**: Enforce the inclusion of at least one special character (e.g., `!`, `@`, `#`).
4. **Require Uppercase Letters**: Enforce the inclusion of at least one uppercase letter.
5. **Require Lowercase Letters**: Enforce the inclusion of at least one lowercase letter.
6. **Allow Users to Change Their Own Password**: Permit users to change their passwords.
7. **Password Expiration**: Set a duration after which passwords must be changed.
8. **Prevent Password Reuse**: Restrict the reuse of previous passwords.

### Example Policy JSON

```json
{
    "MinimumPasswordLength": 8,
    "RequireSymbols": true,
    "RequireNumbers": true,
    "RequireUppercaseCharacters": true,
    "RequireLowercaseCharacters": true,
    "AllowUsersToChangePassword": true,
    "ExpirePasswords": true,
    "MaxPasswordAge": 90,
    "PasswordReusePrevention": 5,
    "HardExpiry": false
}
```
